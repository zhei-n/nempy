## üñ•Ô∏è Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- colorama (for colored output)
- speedtest-cli (auto-installs if missing)
  
## üñ•Ô∏è Steps
- Install Python 3 if not already installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Install colorama (if not already)
- Run the script as Administrator (required for network changes)

## Troubleshooting
- The network scan downloads the IEEE OUI vendor list (oui.txt) on first run for MAC vendor lookup.
- For best results, run the script in a terminal with administrator privileges.
- The script is intended for Windows only.
